	* Released 0.30.

	* Makefile.PL: README generation was buggy.

	* Updated documentation to reflect -no_match_vars in the
	English.pm module.

	* Received a patch from Slaven Rezic that makes FindAmpersend work
	with perl 5.6 and 5.8. Unfortunately not yet for threaded perl
	5.8. Updated the tests.

	* I just received from Doug MacEachern a findampersand package
	which is so cool that I can't wait including it immediately in the
	distribution. Thanks, Doug!!

	* Spotted that I had been inconsequent about the name of the
	module. Was it Devel::SawAmpersand or Debug::SawAmpersand? 0.03
	says Devel:: in *all* places.

1997-12-01

	* Improved documentation about the sawampersand variable
